## Joaquín Sebastián Tschopp

Backend & AI Engineer focused on applied Machine Learning and LLM-based systems.

I design and build production-oriented solutions combining backend services, data pipelines, and machine learning models.  
My experience spans traditional ML (churn, risk, predictive modeling) and modern GenAI systems (RAG, agentic workflows, LLM orchestration), with attention to system design, reliability, and operational constraints.

This GitHub profile serves as a technical complement to my CV, showcasing selected projects that reflect real-world applications rather than isolated experiments.

### Selected Projects

- **AgentesAI**  
  LLM-based agentic workflows for document processing and decision support, using LangChain, FastAPI, and local/cloud LLMs.

- **proyeccion-calidad-agua-ml**  
  Applied machine learning on real-world time series data, including data preparation, modeling, and evaluation pipelines.

- **VC-ARN**  
  Computer Vision experiments focused on neural architectures and applied deep learning techniques.

### Areas of Focus
- Applied Machine Learning
- Backend systems for ML and GenAI
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM orchestration and evaluation
- Production-oriented AI systems
